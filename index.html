        <h1><b>Nelson Mandela</b></h1>
        <blockquote style="text-align: center;"> Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary,
            political leader, and philanthropist who served as the first Black president of South Africa from 1994 to
            1999. Born on July 18, 1918, Mandela became a symbol of resistance against the oppressive apartheid regime,
            advocating for racial equality, justice, and human rights. He spent 27 years in prison for his activism
            before his release in 1990, which marked a turning point in South Africa's history. His leadership in
            fostering reconciliation and democracy in a divided nation earned him global respect, and he was awarded the
            Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his efforts to dismantle apartheid and establish a multiracial democracy.

            <b><u>Early Life and Education (1918–1943):</u></b>Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the village
            of Mvezo in Umtata, South Africa. He belonged to the Thembu royal family of the Xhosa-speaking people.
            Raised in a rural area, Mandela attended local mission schools and later studied at the University of Fort
            Hare, one of the few higher education institutions for Black South Africans at the time. However, he was
            expelled from Fort Hare for participating in a student protest. Mandela later moved to Johannesburg, where
            he completed his Bachelor’s degree via correspondence and began studying law.

            <b><u>Political Awakening and Early Activism (1943–1961):</u></b>
            In Johannesburg, Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1943 and co-founded its Youth League
            in 1944. Inspired by the fight against colonialism and racial discrimination, he became increasingly
            involved in anti-apartheid activities, advocating for the rights of Black South Africans. By the 1950s,
            Mandela had emerged as a key figure in the struggle, organizing protests, boycotts, and strikes against
            apartheid laws. In 1961, Mandela co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe ("Spear of the Nation"), the armed wing of the
            ANC, and began advocating for armed resistance against the apartheid government.

            <b> <u>Imprisonment (1962–1990):</u></b>
            In 1962, Mandela was arrested and convicted of inciting strikes and leaving the country without a passport.
            While in prison, he was charged with sabotage and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 during the Rivonia
            Trial. Mandela spent 27 years in prison, mostly on Robben Island. During his incarceration, he became a
            global symbol of resistance to apartheid and an icon for the struggle for freedom and equality. Despite
            harsh conditions, Mandela continued his fight from behind bars, refusing several offers of conditional
            release that required him to renounce violence.

            <b><u>Release and Presidency (1990–1999):</u></b>
            Nelson Mandela was released from prison on February 11, 1990, as apartheid laws began to be dismantled. He
            immediately became a central figure in negotiating South Africa's transition to a multiracial democracy. In
            1993, Mandela and then-President F.W. de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts
            in ending apartheid peacefully. In 1994, Mandela
